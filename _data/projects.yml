    RONM focuses on improving the resiliency of power systems with optimization-based methods that leverage advanced microgrid technologies to reduce system recovery times after extreme event induced outages. This project is a unique, high-fidelity physics-based optimization method for modeling networked microgrids which includes key engineering constraints associated with system recovery after extreme events. Our NREL team is focusing on developing the high-fidelity power system models, along with the microgrid design use-cases and the real-time hardware-in-the-loop test bed for evaluating the optimization based solver.
