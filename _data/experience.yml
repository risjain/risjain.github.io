    Involved in multiple projects involved in power system modeling, optimal control design, development of real-time and quasi-steady-state test platform development. The outcomes are intended for applications in transportation electrification for delivery fleets, sustainable grid integration of renewables, and exploring alternate energy resources (hydrogen based) for grid support and vehicle fueling. Research outcomes have resulted in new funding opportunities and research collaborations resulting in $1M+ funding through my involvement. I am also leading multiple projects, mentoring others, and co-authoring multiple research papers and one record of invention.

    - Term 1: Involved in a diverse body of projects involving 1) Review of power and energy reserve requirements for large systems (book chapter published), 2) Proving the sensitivity of the system stability to fault location given the location of DERs (conference publication), and 3) Use of support-vector machines to improve wind power forecast with added consideration of wind turbulence.    
    - Term 2: Involved in two projects focused on i) sustainable fleet electrification for delivery businesses, and, ii) Grid support using hydrogen based electrolyzers for distribution systems with high PV penetration. Outcomes resulted in sustained funding for future research in the area, and early benchmark test platform development for evaluating fleet electrification use-cases.

    - As a RA, involved in multiple projects focused on microgrid design and control, lifetime assesment of storage cells, and reconfiguration and adaptive protection of distribution systems with high renewable penetration. The outcomes helped me defend my doctoral dissertation and multiple peer-reviewed publications. 
      o My use-case contributions to Electrocon's CAPE - a well known power system protection analysis tool - resulted in a 1-year support from Electrocon for FREEDM Systems Center with software license, and help from their researchers developing their new TS-Link Module.
    - As a TA, I have been actively involved in helping develop the course curriculum, deliver lectures, in addition to my responsibilities as an lab instructor and grader. I also helped redesign the protection systems lab setup, and utilized my previous experience from Schweitzer Engineering Labs as a protection engineer - to upgrade the lab exercise outcomes and procedures to industry standards.

    Executed multiple development and modeling projects to help the lead engineers analyze power system disturbances, and develop new protection algorithms. 
    - Responsible for developing low-voltage control test setup and hardware evaluation for validating the simulation results.
    - Well regarded for my knack to develop robust, scalable and automated test routines - which allowed our research group to perform rigourous testing and validations involving both hardware/software safely.
    - The efforts resulted in multiple publications over my 15-month internship, and a long-standing relationship with my former mentors.
