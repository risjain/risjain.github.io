    Involved in multiple projects involved in power system modeling, optimal control design, development of real-time and quasi-steady-state test platform development. The outcomes are intended for applications in transportation electrification for delivery fleets, sustainable grid integration of renewables, and exploring alternate energy resources (hydrogen based) for grid support and vehicle fueling. Research outcomes have resulted in new funding opportunities and research collaborations resulting in $1M+ funding through my involvement. I am also leading multiple projects, mentoring others, and co-authoring multiple research papers and one record of invention.
