    Involved in multiple projects involved in power system modeling, <mark>optimal control design</mark>, development of <mark>real-time</mark> and <mark>quasi-steady-state test platform</mark> development. The outcomes are intended for applications in transportation electrification for <mark>delivery vehicle</mark> fleets, <mark>sustainable grid integration of renewables</mark>, and exploring alternate energy resources (hydrogen based) for <mark>grid support</mark> and <mark>vehicle fueling</mark>. Research outcomes have resulted in new funding opportunities and research collaborations resulting in $1M+ funding through my involvement. I am also leading multiple projects, mentoring others, and co-authoring multiple research papers and one record of invention.

    - Term 1: Involved in a diverse body of projects involving 1) Review of power and energy reserve requirements for bulk power systems (book chapter published), 2) Proving the sensitivity of the <mark>system stability</mark> to fault location given the location of DERs (conference publication), and 3) Use of <mark>support-vector machines</mark> to improve wind power forecast with added consideration of wind turbulence.    
    - Term 2: Involved in two projects focused on i) <mark>sustainable fleet electrification</mark> for delivery businesses, and, ii) <mark>Grid ancillary service</mark> support using hydrogen based electrolyzers for distribution systems with <mark>high PV penetration</mark>. Outcomes resulted in sustained funding for future research in the area, and early benchmark test platform development for evaluating fleet electrification use-cases.

    - As a RA, involved in multiple projects focused on microgrid design and control, <mark>lifetime assesment of storage cells</mark>, and <mark>reconfiguration</mark> and <mark>adaptive protection</mark> of distribution systems with <mark>high renewable penetration</mark>. The outcomes helped me defend my doctoral dissertation and multiple peer-reviewed publications. 
      o My use-case contributions to Electrocon's CAPE - a well known power system protection analysis tool - resulted in a <mark>1-year support</mark> from Electrocon for FREEDM Systems Center with software license, and help from their researchers developing their new TS-Link Module.
    - As a TA, I have been actively involved in helping develop the course curriculum, deliver lectures, in addition to my responsibilities as an lab instructor and grader. I also helped redesign the protection systems lab setup, and utilized my previous experience from Schweitzer Engineering Labs as a protection engineer - to upgrade the lab exercise outcomes and procedures to industry standards.
