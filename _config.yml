  Hi, my name is Rishabh. I am a research engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the Power Systems Engineering Center. I am leading multiple research projects focused on transportation electrification, sustainable grid integration of renewables, networked microgrids, and market opportunities for grid support services. My expertise is in quasi-steady-state and real-time hardware-in-the-loop power system modeling, grid protection from faults, and, control, design and operation of microgrids.
